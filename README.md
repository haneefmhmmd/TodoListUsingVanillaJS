# TodoList


This is a simple todolist build using html, css and js.
For storing the todos I have used the local storage of the browser.

The concepts I learned by building this project are as follows,
 - Learned about how to create a simple web application using html, css and vanilla js.
 - Learnt how to store and fetch items from the local storage.
